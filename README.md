# Project_FoodhubEDA
Using Exploratory Data Analysis for a food delivery service company and providing recommendations and observations based off the analysis of the dataset
Used Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze delivery and preparation times to various restaurants.
Provided observations and recommendations based off of the analysis.

I chose to approach this project the full code method--write code from scratch and then provide actions and insights at the end.
Other option was low code The low-code way is to use an existing solution notebook template to build the solution and then submit a business presentation with insights and recommendations. Full code is geared towards those who aspire to be in hands-on coding roles focusing on building solution codes from scratch Low-code way is geared towards those who aspire to be in managerial roles focusing on solution review, interpretation and communicating with business stakeholders.

I took the full-code route since I want to get stronger at my coding
